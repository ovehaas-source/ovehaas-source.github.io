# Binance / Bybit P2P Bot 🚀

**Consistently Staying TOP1 in a Highly Competitive Market**

This repository serves as the root domain for [ovehaas-source.github.io](https://ovehaas-source.github.io/). 

### 🌟 Project Overview
As P2P markets on major exchanges like **Binance** and **Bybit** mature, manual price adjustment can no longer keep up with fierce competition. Our open-source bots help merchants:
* **Stay TOP1:** Automatically adjust prices based on real-time market data.
* **24/7 Operation:** Unattended bidding for USDT, BTC, ETH, and other volatile assets.
* **Inventory Management:** Auto-replenish ad inventory based on account balances.
